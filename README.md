## Project name: Cloud Data Engineer Project

**Introduction:** The CDE project's main purpose is to provide additional technical training for the cloud engineering and related tracks for OptimumHIT CareerPath (OCP) training program. However, it is also designed to be a shared respostiory where analysts can contribute additional content or showcase what they have been learning throughout their tech track. Here, analysts will be able to create resources that can be used by future OCP members.

**Description:** The project's objective is to help introduce analysts to the popular tools used for software development and how operations are performed in the cloud. Analysts will be using programming tools to create a basic website and deploy it within the cloud. By doing so, they will become more familiar with software development along with the core components of cloud computing including: identity and access management, computing and storage resources, networking, and security.

**Constraints:** Basic knowledge gained from the CDE tech track is required (Linux CLI, Python, and cloud concepts). Analysts who have more technical experience are encouraged to take advantage of the provided resources and contribute to the development of this ongoing project.

**Goals:** 
- Create and work with software development and automation tools
- Understand how IAM allows and restricts access
- Launch and manage cloud resources
- Become familiar with how cloud resources are managed at scale

**Modules:**
- Module A - Introduction to software development
- Module B - Introduction to cloud operations
- Module C - Maintaining and modifying existing resources
